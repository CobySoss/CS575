## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(reticulate)
```


```{python}
import miditime
from miditime.miditime import MIDITime

# Instantiate the class with a tempo (120bpm is the default) and an output file destination.
mymidi = MIDITime(120, 'myfile.mid')

# Create a list of notes. Each note is a list: [time, pitch, velocity, duration]
midinotes = [
    [0, 60, 127, 3],  #At 0 beats (the start), Middle C with velocity 127, for 3 beats
    [10, 61, 127, 4]  #At 10 beats (12 seconds from start), C#5 with velocity 127, for 4 beats
]

# Add a track with those notes
mymidi.add_track(midinotes)

# Output the .mid file
mymidi.save_midi()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
